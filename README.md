# ðŸ§  DSA Practice Log

Welcome to my structured DSA & Problem-Solving journey!  
This repository contains problems I've solved from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Folder Structure

- `arrays/` â€“ Array-based problems
- `strings/` â€“ String manipulations
- `trees/` â€“ Tree traversal and operations
- `graphs/` â€“ Graph traversal algorithms
- `dynamic_programming/` â€“ DP-based problems

## ðŸ“˜ Master Tracker
Check `PROBLEM_HISTORY.md` for a full history of all problems solved.

## ðŸ”¥ Goal
To practice and document coding problems regularly for mastering algorithms, improving speed, and preparing for interviews.
